WOIS_Processing
===============

WOIS version of the QGIS Processing plugin. 

The aim is to keep a stable version of the Processing plugin while ensuring that it is as similar as possible to the QGIS verions. However, there could be some features and bug fixes which have not yet been implemented in the official QGIS Processing plugin and vice versa. 

Created as part of the Water Observation Information System (WOIS) developed under the TIGER-NET project funded by the European Space Agency as part of the long-term TIGER initiative aiming at promoting the use of Earth Observation (EO) for improved Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in Africa.
